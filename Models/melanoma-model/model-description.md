Preprocessing Notebook: 

Contains Image Augmentation, train and test images displayed as well as all the preprocessing pipelines. 

Model Training Notebook: 

Contains Training Hyperparameters, model specifics, conversion to TFlite from the datasets obtained in Preprocessing Notebook,
The code has been repeated so skip to model building to see the model build and usage. We have obtained a train AUC of 96.0 
and saved the model weights, and also the TFlite model has been included in the folder. This will be loaded in the App Folder.

For TFLite model and Inference code refer to Models-TFLite
